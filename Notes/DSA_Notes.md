**DSA Notes**

1 Why Data Structures Matter
- Introduces the concept of data structures as tools to organize and manage data efficiently.
- Emphasizes that writing correct code isn’t enough—performance matters.
- Real-world analogy choosing the right container for storing items affects how quickly you can find or use them.

 2 Arrays and Linked Lists
- Explains arrays fixed-size, fast access via index, slow insert/delete.
- Linked lists dynamic size, fast insert/delete, slow access.
- Use cases arrays for frequent access, linked lists for frequent insertions.

 3 Big O Notation
- Big O as a way to measure algorithm efficiency.
- Compares time complexity O(1), O(n), O(n²), etc.
- Encourages thinking about scalability how performance changes with input size.

 4 Stacks and Queues
- Stack LIFO (Last In, First Out), used in undo features, parsing.
- Queue FIFO (First In, First Out), used in task scheduling, print jobs.
- Both are simple but powerful tools for managing order.

 5 Hash Tables
- Hash tables store key-value pairs with fast access.
- Ideal for lookups, caching, and dictionaries.
- Hash functions, collisions, and handling techniques like chaining.

 6 Trees and Binary Search Trees
- Trees represent hierarchical data (e.g., file systems).
- Binary Search Trees (BST) efficient searching, inserting, deleting.
- Balanced trees (like AVL or Red-Black) maintain performance.

 7 Recursion
- Recursion a function calling itself to solve smaller instances.
- Useful for tree traversal, divide-and-conquer algorithms.
- Includes tips to avoid stack overflow and improve clarity.

 8 Sorting Algorithms
- Covers bubble, selection, insertion, merge, and quick sort.
- Compares efficiency merge and quick sort are faster for large datasets.
- Sorting is foundational for many other algorithms.

 9 Graphs and Graph Algorithms
- Graphs model relationships social networks, maps, dependencies.
- Explains depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra’s algorithm.
- Highlights real-world applications like route planning and recommendation systems.

 10 Real-World Problem Solving
- Encourages applying data structures and algorithms to practical coding problems.
- Offers strategies for choosing the right structure.
- Reinforces the mindset clarity, efficiency, and adaptability are key.
